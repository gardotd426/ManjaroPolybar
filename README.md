# ManjaroPolybar
Manjaro Polybar config. The config is a mess (as in it has a bunch of extra fonts I used to use but don't anymore, and didn't want to go through and change all the module fonts and whatnot). But the files I use are as follows:
new.ini is the config file
new.sh is what I use in i3 to launch the bars.
the scripts go into a folder in your polybar config folder titled "scripts"
As far as dependencies, the only one for the modules in the config I THINK is mpd and obviously i3.
yes, the bars are called mainbar-xmonad1 and 2, change them if you want, I edited an old config file but never changed the bar titles. No big deal.
There are a ton of unused modules, but all of them should work as long as you edit things like the wireless interface for networkspeeddown and all that.
I've tried to always use ~/ for folder paths as opposed to /home/matt/example, but be aware you may need to go in and change them to your own paths if something isn't working quite right. 
If something's not working just message me on reddit u/gardotd426.
